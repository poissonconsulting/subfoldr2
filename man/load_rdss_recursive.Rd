\usage{
load_rdss_recursive(
  x_name = ".*",
  class,
  sub = sbf_get_sub(),
  main = sbf_get_main(),
  include_root = TRUE,
  tag = ".*",
  meta = FALSE,
  drop = NULL,
  fun = NULL,
  ext = "rds"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_name}{A string of the name.}

\item{class}{Class of object to import, which determines the sub to import from.}

\item{sub}{A string specifying the path to the sub folder (by default the
current sub folder).}

\item{main}{A string specifying the path to the main folder (by default the
current main folder)}

\item{include_root}{A flag indicating whether to include objects in the top}

\item{tag}{A string of the regular expression that the tag must match to be
included.}

\item{meta}{A flag specifying whether to include the report, caption and any
other metadata as columns.}

\item{drop}{A character vector specifying the sub folders and file names not
to import or \code{NULL} (the default).}

\item{fun}{function to apply to the object after import (\code{NULL} by default)}

\item{ext}{Extension of the files (\code{".rds"} by default)}
}
\description{
\strong{NOTE}: Currently only an internal function and not tested.
}
\details{
Recursively loads all RDS files with names matching the regular expression
\code{x_name} as the first (list) column (named \code{object}) in a data frame.
Subsequent character vector columns specify the object names (named name)
and sub folders (named sub1, sub2 etc).
}
\concept{load functions
\code{drop = ""} drops all elements, since they all match "", and thus causes
issues with \code{data.frame(x = I(objects))} below:
\verb{replacement has 1 row, data has 0}}
