\usage{
sbf_upload_flobs_to_db(
  db_name = sbf_get_db_name(),
  sub = sbf_get_sub(),
  main = sbf_get_main(),
  dir = NULL,
  dbflobr_sub = FALSE,
  exists = FALSE,
  replace = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_name}{A string of the database name.}

\item{sub}{A logical scalar specifying whether to import flobs based on their filename (sub = FALSE)
or the name of their subdirectory (sub = TRUE) which must only contain 1 file.
If sub = NA and replace = TRUE then the names of the
subdirectories are used irrespective of whether they include files and existing
flobs are deleted if the corresponding subdirectory is empty.
If sub = TRUE or sub = NA then recursion is just one subfolder deep.}

\item{main}{A string specifying the path to the main folder (by default the current main folder)}

\item{dir}{A string of the path to the directory to import the files from.
Files need to be within nested folders like 'table1/column1/a.csv'.
This structure is created automatically if save_all_flobs() function is used.}

\item{dbflobr_sub}{A logical scalar specifying whether to import flobs based on their filename (sub = FALSE)
or the name of their subdirectory (sub = TRUE) which must only contain 1 file.
If sub = NA and replace = TRUE then the names of the
subdirectories are used irrespective of whether they include files and existing
flobs are deleted if the corresponding subdirectory is empty.
If sub = TRUE or sub = NA then recursion is just one subfolder deep.}

\item{exists}{A logical scalar specifying whether the column must (TRUE) or
mustn't (FALSE) already exist or whether it doesn't matter (NA).
IF FALSE, a new BLOB column is created.}

\item{replace}{A flag indicating whether to replace existing flobs (TRUE) or not (FALSE).}
}
\value{
An invisible named list indicating directory path, file names and whether files were successfully written to database.
}
\description{
Uploads all files to database by default dir = NULL 
then uploads flobs subdirectory corresponding to database using
dbflobr::import_all_flobs().
